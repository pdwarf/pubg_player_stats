# Required data and folder structure to run the analysis
To get this code to run for you, first you have to download the data from Kaggle. I recommend using their API for this. You can see how to get started with this here: https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api. Once you've done the steps outlined there, obtain the PUBG data from with this command in the command line: ```kaggle datasets download -d skihikingkevin/pubg-match-deaths```

Then, extract the zip file to a subfolder called "data".
